# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

#Description

The challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will need take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize and it will need to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I will create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria for it being met.

#User-Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

#Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
